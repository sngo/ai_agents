My name is Son Ngo.  I am a software engineer mostly on java related technologies but recently I am exploring to Agentic AI.
My Agentic AI github is https://github.com/sngo/llms-practice.
I have been working on small project in Agentic AI such as task_management, Synthetic_Data.
I am still learning and improving my skill on AI.
I have Google Cloud Associate Clound engineer certification.

In my free time, I like to play guitar, taking landscape pictures and travel around the world.  
I also participate in Vietnamese community to advocate for human right in Viet Nam. 
And of course keep learning AI technologies as it moving so fast.

# `accounts.py` Module Design

This module provides the implementation of a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It allows users to create an account, make deposits and withdrawals, buy and sell shares, and keep track of their portfolio's value and transaction history.

## Class: `Account`

### Attributes:
- `account_id: str` - Unique identifier for the account.
- `balance: float` - The cash balance available in the account.
- `initial_deposit: float` - The initial deposit made to the account.
- `holdings: Dict[str, int]` - Dictionary holding share symbols and the quantity owned.
- `transactions: List[Dict]` - List of all transactions made on the account.

### Methods:

#### `__init__(self, account_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
- Initializes a new account with the given account ID and initial deposit. Sets up the initial balance and empty holdings and transactions list.

#### `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
- Adds the specified `amount` to the account balance.

#### `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
- Withdraws the specified `amount` from the account if it does not result in a negative balance. Returns `True` if withdrawal is successful, otherwise `False`.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Purchases the specified `quantity` of shares for the given `symbol` if sufficient balance is available. Updates the balance and holdings. Returns `True` if the purchase is successful, otherwise `False`.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
- Sells the specified `quantity` of shares for the given `symbol` if the account holds enough shares. Updates the balance and holdings. Returns `True` if the sale is successful, otherwise `False`.

#### `get_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
- Calculates and returns the total value of the portfolio by summing the current value of all held shares and the cash balance.

#### `get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float`
- Calculates and returns the profit or loss relative to the initial deposit by comparing the current portfolio value with the initial deposit.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> Dict[str, int]`
- Returns a dictionary of the current holdings, showing each share symbol and the quantity held.

#### `get_transactions(self) -> List[Dict]`
- Returns a list of all transactions that have occurred on the account, including deposits, withdrawals, and trades.

### Internal/Helper Method:

#### `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
- Mock implementation that returns fixed prices for known symbols (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL) and can be replaced with a real price fetching function. This function is used to determine the price for purchases and sales of shares.

### Usage:

1. Create an `Account` with a unique `account_id` and `initial_deposit`.
2. Use `deposit_funds` and `withdraw_funds` for managing cash.
3. Record share purchases with `buy_shares` and sales with `sell_shares`.
4. Retrieve portfolio status using `get_portfolio_value`, `get_profit_or_loss`, and `get_holdings`.
5. Access transaction history with `get_transactions`.

This design provides a detailed description of the `Account` class and its methods, ensuring the module is self-contained and ready for further implementation, testing, or simple UI integration.
